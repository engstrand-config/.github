## 🐧 The Engstrand GNU/Linux configuration

This organization houses our ([Johan](https://github.com/johanengstrand) & [Fredrik](https://github.com/Frewacom) Engstrand) GNU/Linux configuration.

We used Arch Linux for around two years before we saw the light and jumped ship to the fantastic [GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/) in the summer of 2021.
